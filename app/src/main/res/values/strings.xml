    <!-- 1. In strings.xml, add the following affirmations as individual string resources.
    Name them affirmation1, affirmation2, and so on
    Now that you have added string resources, you can reference them in your code as
    R.string.affirmation1 or R.string.affirmation2.-->

    <!-- 2. Create a package
    In Android Studio, in the Project pane, right-click app > java > com.example.affirmations
    and select New > Package.
    In the New Package popup, notice the suggested package name prefix. The suggested first part
    of the package name is the name of the package you right-clicked. While package names do not
    create a hierarchy of packages, reusing parts of the name is used to indicate a relationship
    and organization of the content!
    In the popup, append model to the end of the suggested package name. Developers often use
    model as the package name for classes that model (or represent) the data.
    Press Enter. This creates a new package under the com.example.affirmations (root) package.
    This new package will contain any data-related classes defined in your app.
    -->
    <!-- 3. Create the Affirmation data class
    In this task, you'll create a class called Affirmation. An object instance of Affirmation
    represents one affirmation and contains the resource ID of the string with the affirmation.
    Right-click on the com.example.affirmations.model package and select New > Kotlin File/Class.
    In the popup, select Class and enter Affirmation as the name of the class. This creates a new
    file called Affirmation.kt in the model package.
    Open Affirmation.kt
    -->
